# 🧠 Road to Practitioner (R2P) – IBM Quantum Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my progress through the **Road to Practitioner (R2P)** program by IBM Quantum during **Spring–Summer 2025**.

This repo contains all the Jupyter notebooks, exercises, and notes I've worked on as part of this hands-on learning experience — covering the fundamentals of **quantum computing** and **Qiskit**.

## 🌐 About the Program

**Road to Practitioner (R2P)** is a structured and community-driven quantum computing program developed by **IBM Quantum**. It’s designed to take participants on a learning journey **from curious learner to capable practitioner**.

### 🔍 Program Highlights:

- **Target Audience**: Researchers, educators, students, and professionals from diverse backgrounds
- **Cohort-Based**: Time-bound and community-supported structure
- **Two Phases, Six Units**: Combining theory with hands-on practical experience
- **Modular & Flexible**: Tailored to suit different levels and interests
- **Guided Learning**: Based on state-of-the-art IBM Quantum Learning Platform content
- **Hands-On Labs**: Capstone project, exercises, and Qiskit Developer Certification prep
- **Mentorship & Support**: Office hours and mentor access throughout
- **Solid Foundation for R2U**: Sets the stage for the more advanced *Road to Utility (R2U)* program

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you'd like to explore or run the notebooks:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dosqas/R2P-Quantum-Qiskit-Exploration.git
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
